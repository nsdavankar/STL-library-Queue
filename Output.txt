This program uses to STL library container Queue to create a queue. This
program adds elements to a queue, deletes elements from a queue, returns
the front element of a queue, checks if a queue is empty or full. The 
program can also print all the elements in the queue. This programs has
a copy constructor and it can copy all the elements of the queue in another
queue. 

Character Queue
Enqueue  a  b  c  d  e  f  
Dequeue  d  e  f  
Enqueue  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  
Dequeue  Queue is empty
Is Empty?  Queue is empty
Is Full?  Queue is not full
Front of the Queue?  Queue is empty so nothing is in the front
Copy constructor is called - Queue is empty so nothing is copied

Integer Queue
Enqueue  1  2  3  4  5  6  
Dequeue  3  4  5  6  
Enqueue  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
Dequeue  7  8  9  
Is Empty?  Queue is not empty
Is Full?  Queue is not full
Front of the Queue?  7
Copy constructor is called - Copied items are -7  8  9  

Double Queue
Enqueue  1.1  2.2  3.3  4.4  5.5  6.6  
Dequeue  2.2  3.3  4.4  5.5  6.6  
Enqueue  2.2  3.3  4.4  5.5  6.6  7.7  8.8  
Dequeue  7.7  8.8  
Is Empty?  Queue is not empty
Is Full?  Queue is not full
Front of the Queue?  7.7
Copy constructor is called - Copied items are -7.7  8.8  

Testing true condition for isFULL()
Enqueue  7.7  8.8  7.7  8.8  9.9  1.1  2.2  3.3  4.4  5.5  
Is Full?  Queue is full
